# Literal parser

## Requirements
GNU compiler (to process string literal)

## Usage
Use it to calculate expression with `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `|`, `^`, `&` binary operators and `+`, `-`, `~` unary. It will evaluate it in `int`. `Integer.MIN_VALUE` can't be represented as a constant

## Warning
This parser was written during educational research. Hence wasn't tested enough and shouldn't be used in real projects.
